# BEST - Bicyling Etiquette made SmarT

## THE PROBLEM
In cycling, road etiquette suggests that you indicate your intention to turn by outstretching your arm straight out to the side before you start moving in that direction. (see
https://roadcyclinguk.com/how-to/technique/essential-guide-road-cycling-hand-signals-calls.html for example for some information).
This is a very important skill to learn and use, and it is important to teach the children to respect it.
However, riding the bicycle with only one hand for several seconds might be dangerous, especially for young children and/or on an uneven road.
Moreover, these hand signals might not be easily visible in poor weather conditions, and definitely they are not visible at all at night without any external light source.
## PROPOSED SOLUTION
The idea is to build a smart jacket which is activated by respecting the proper road etiquette. Stretching the arm on the right side for 1 second, for example, will activate an animation that will signal the intention to turn for the whole duration of the turn. The user can place their hands back on the handlebar for the remaining time, thus minimising the risk of fall and maximising the control of the bicycle.
A rewarding sound for each successful turn will reinforce the positive message to respect the cycling etiquette.

### ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS
* Detect raised arm for an extended period of time (1 second, for example)
* Discriminate between LEFT and RIGHT turns
* Display the intended turn through visual animation for an extensive period of time (enough to clear the turn)
* Working at least on regular, smooth road only
* Battery powered for at least 2 hours of continuous use
* Work with non-wet weather
* single light with different animations in different colours

### OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- integrated in a high-vis vest
- Work on different types of roads, including dirt roads, uneven roads, etc
- Work with different weather conditions (waterproofing)
- removal of false activations
- Detection of other signals such as STOP (Raise a hand straight above your head) and SLOWING (With your arm outstretched, palm-down, and slightly behind you so cyclists behind you get a clear view of your hand, move your hand up and down at the wrist to indicate that youâ€™re about to slow. )
- sound effect to reward the user for the successfully executed signal
- 3 lights (both arms and head/shoulder) working together.
- detection of the actual duration of the turn, and
- clicking sound (similar to what you hear in your car) to confirm the system works as intended.


## Materials used
- Arduino Nano or suitable equivalent
- prototyping board 
- 2x Neopixel Rings (12 pixels) 
- 2x MPU6050
- 9V battery (anything would work as long as it can power all the system up) 
- Rocker switch with LED (or suitable equivalent)
- plenty of hot glue (Mark Rober's Style ;-) )
- suitable case (I used an old business card box) 
- recycleable T-shirt (or vest, or similar)
